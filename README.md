For now im learning to use Linux and DSA so this project is pause for a time.
This is a basic ETL project. I use Scrapy, Playwright and proxies to scrape 2 websites: Vietnamworks and Careerlink.
I use Pyspark to clean and normalize the data(Over 1000 records, i want to crawl more but because of limit number of proxies).
I store data in Parquet file to use later.
